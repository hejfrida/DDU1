            <p>
                Say goodbye to scattered chew toys and different versions of the same bone. Keep everything in one

                ‚ÄúBefore Barky, all the best sniffing spots were locked in the heads of a few top dogs. 
                Now every pup feels empowered to fetch their own info and zoom around like a greyhound.‚Äù

            <blockquote>
                ‚ÄúWe used to bark out meeting recaps all the time. But now the pack knows where to sniff if they have
