                “Barky helps us keep an eye on all 30+ squirrel-chasing missions we have going at once. 
                We can sniff out any of them to get the full scoop right away.”

            <h3>Your online kennel</h3>

            <p>
                Say goodbye to scattered chew toys and different versions of the same bone. Keep everything in one
                spot, so every pup has what they need to wag their tails and do their best tricks.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “Before Barky, all the best sniffing spots were locked in the heads of a few top dogs. 
                Now every pup feels empowered to fetch their own info and zoom around like a greyhound.”

            <h3>Docs that keep pups in a row</h3>

            <p>
                Meeting barks, treat planning, sniffing docs — log all crucial decisions and let the pack know who’s
                fetching what and when.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “We used to bark out meeting recaps all the time. But now the pack knows where to sniff if they have
                a question about the plan or anything else.”
